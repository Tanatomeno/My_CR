# Learning Repository for Cognitive Robotics with ROS and Rasa

This repository is intended solely for personal learning and 
experimentation with **ROS (Robot Operating System)** and **Rasa**, 
focusing on cognitive robotics and conversational AI. 
It contains code and projects used to practice and 
explore the fundamentals of robotic frameworks, natural 
language understanding, and dialogue systems.

Please note that this repository is not designed for reusability 
or as production-ready code. The examples here are for educational 
purposes and may not follow best practices or be optimized for 
real-world applications.

Feel free to explore, but be aware that the code is intended 
only for personal learning and experimentation, and not as a 
framework or library for any specific purpose

**Important note:** I will integrate examples that are not mine
